## Proyek

### KOLING - Emergency Services Application

Koling is an innovative mobile application aimed at facilitating seamless communication with emergency and general services in Indonesia. With Koling, users can access a centralized platform and conveniently request public services, including police, ambulance, and firefighter assistance, among others, without needing to memorize or manually dial multiple numbers. This is especially important in Indonesia, where emergency services are decentralized and people may not know which number to call in times of need. Koling streamlines this process and provides quick access to essential services, improving overall public safety and response times. The Machine learning algorithm will train the data to give predictions upon several things such as the category of the report to filter the same accident report and cluster of areas which have high criminality, high possibility of crash, etc.  The Cloud computing will create APIs that mobile development teams can use to build applications.
