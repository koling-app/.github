### KOLING - Emergency Services Application

Koling is an innovative mobile application aimed at facilitating seamless communication with emergency and general services in Indonesia. With Koling, users can access a centralized platform and conveniently request public services, including police, ambulance, and firefighter assistance, among others, without needing to memorize or manually dial multiple numbers. This is especially important in Indonesia, where emergency services are decentralized and people may not know which number to call in times of need. Koling streamlines this process and provides quick access to essential services, improving overall public safety and response times. The Machine learning algorithm will try to predict service that user need based on their voice request. Besides that, Machine Learning algorithm will also predict the nearest institution based on user coordinate. The Cloud computing will create APIs that mobile development teams can use to build applications.
